This is fork of 2nd Quake engine, with Code::Blocks workspace, and few MinGW fixes. 
Both versions (ctf and game) and renderers (Software and OGL) "should" work.

Fabien Sanglard articles about Quake sources helped a lot with this version

Game should be compiled without problems, but DirectSound headers and libs should 
be present in compiler search path
